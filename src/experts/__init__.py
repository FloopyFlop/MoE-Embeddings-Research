Mixture of Experts components - to be implemented in the next phase.

This module will contain:
- Expert networks (specialized feed-forward networks)
- Gating mechanisms (learned routing)
- MoE layers to replace standard feed-forward layers in the transformer
- Load balancing mechanisms to ensure experts are used evenly
